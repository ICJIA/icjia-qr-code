# URL Validation Improvements

## Overview

The URL validation system has been enhanced to handle edge cases more effectively by integrating the `validator` npm package. This implementation provides more robust URL validation while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing codebase.

## Changes Made

1. Added the `validator` npm package as a dependency
2. Created a new enhanced URL validator module (`src/utils/enhanced-url-validator.js`)
3. Updated the existing URL validator to use the enhanced version
4. Added comprehensive tests for the enhanced validator

## Features of the Enhanced Validator

The enhanced URL validator now handles the following edge cases:

- Unescaped spaces in URLs (rejected with helpful error messages and suggested corrections)
- Properly encoded spaces (%20) in URLs (accepted)
- Special characters in URLs (properly encoded)
- Multiple trailing slashes (detected and corrected)
- Multiple consecutive slashes in paths (normalized)
- Malformed URLs (better error messages)
- Query parameters with spaces or special characters (rejected if unescaped, accepted if properly encoded)
- Hash fragments with spaces or special characters (rejected if unescaped, accepted if properly encoded)
- International characters in URLs

## Usage

The API remains the same, so existing code will continue to work without changes:

```javascript
import { sanitizeAndValidateURL } from "./utils/url-validator.js";

const validationResult = sanitizeAndValidateURL(url);
if (!validationResult.isValid) {
  console.warn("URL validation failed:", validationResult.error);
  // Handle error
  return;
}

// Use the validated and sanitized URL
const sanitizedUrl = validationResult.url || validationResult.suggestedUrl || validationResult.originalUrl;
```

## Testing

Two comprehensive test suites have been added to verify the functionality of the enhanced validator:

1. `test/enhanced-url-validation.test.js` - Tests specific features of the enhanced URL validator
2. `test/static-url-validation.test.js` - Tests a static set of 30 URLs (15 valid, 15 invalid) to ensure consistent validation

Run the tests with:

```bash
yarn test
```

The static URL test suite uses a predefined set of URLs from `test/fixtures/test-urls.json` to ensure consistent test results across different environments.

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more TLDs beyond the current limited set
2. Implement internationalized domain name (IDN) support
3. Add options to customize validation strictness
4. Improve performance for large batches of URL validations
